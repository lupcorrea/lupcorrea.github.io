### Brief Description

This project's idea rose while chatting with a great friend before some college meeting. We were discussing about what companies would like to see in people before hiring them, and we reached the point where we were checking some cool online portfolios, and we got to the same thought: *"I need to make one of those for me!"*

Furthermore, I never really liked the old curriculum sheet format, where you put a lot of things that seldom get actually read by the HR department. To top it off, there is a federal curriculum system in my country, [the Lattes system] (http://lattes.cnpq.br), where people basically fill their informations in there, and a standard formatted curriculum is generated. The academics here love this! Although great, - and very complete, I must admit -, it doesn't have that freedom feeling to express the things you are able to do, the way you want to show it.

Thus, if I can study a little bit more to do it, why not? Knowledge is always welcome, mainly when applied to a good purpose.

This was the January Project for the Year of Work superproject (still to be described).

### Assets and plugins used

All the icons used in the "General Skills" section were gladly taken from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com). More specifically:

* coding by Chameleon Design from the Noun Project
* leadership by Becris from the Noun Project
* Project Mandate by www.yugudesign.com from the Noun Project
* innovation by Chameleon Design from the Noun Project
* wireframe design by Alfredo from the Noun Project
* circuit by Creative Stall from the Noun Project

Also, I used the great [fullPage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) plugin to make the beautiful scroll happen.

### Special Thanks

* [Thiago Castor](https://www.castorphotos.com), for aiding me with the artistic fixes.

### General Stats
* As in version 1.0, approximately 20 hours were invested. I really lost count on this one, so that's a wild guess. This included:
  * Researching
  * Designing
  * Gathering feedback from the design
  * Redesigning (x4)
  * Coding
  * Fixing stuff
  * More coding and more redesigning (x4)
  * Updating description of old and forgotten repositories
  * Updating description on social networks
  * Gathering partial feedback and adding final artistic touches
* New musical genres discovered:
  * Dark Country/Frontier (lots of playlists on YouTube)
  * Wild Western
  
### To Do Hitlist:
* Optimize the code
* Organize the assets
* ~~Add popup screens on the portfolio section~~ Totally revamp the Portfolio and Skills sections
* Increase descriptions, the page is still too vague
* Make the page responsive, it is awfully buggy in phones
* Whatever else further feedback suggests
